## 🎯 Gameplay Instructions

### Controls
- **Mobile**: Tap anywhere to shoot at that location
- **Desktop**: Click to shoot, WASD/Arrows to move (optional)

### Objective
- Protect the planet from incoming meteors
- Destroy meteors before they hit
- Survive waves to increase your score
- Each meteor hit reduces planet health

### Tips
- Small meteors are fast but weak
- Large meteors are slow but deal heavy damage
- Watch for exploding meteors (red glow) - destroy them near other meteors for chain reactions
- Ultra-fast meteors (blue glow) require quick reflexes
- Maintain combo by destroying meteors consecutively
