## 🎮 Quick Implementation Guide

### Minimal Viable Game (MVP)

**Goal:** Playable game in 1 week

```dart
// 1. Main Game Class
class MeteorMadnessGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add planet, player, start spawning meteors
  }
}

// 2. Player Component
class PlayerComponent extends SpriteComponent {
  // Orbital movement, shooting
}

// 3. Meteor Component
class MeteorComponent extends SpriteComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  // Movement toward planet, collision
}

// 4. Weapon System
abstract class Weapon {
  void fire(Vector2 position, Vector2 direction);
}

// 5. Game Screen Widget
class GameScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GameWidget(game: MeteorMadnessGame());
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 Core Formulas

### Difficulty Scaling
```dart
// Wave difficulty increases
int meteorCount = 5 + (waveNumber * 2);
double meteorSpeed = 100 * (1 + waveNumber * 0.1);
```

### Damage Calculation
```dart
int actualDamage = baseDamage * weaponLevelMultiplier * comboMultiplier;
```

### Scoring
```dart
int score = basePoints * comboMultiplier;
// Combo: 1.0 + (consecutiveHits * 0.1), max 5.0x
```

### Spawn Rate
```dart
double spawnRate = max(0.5, 2.0 - (waveNumber * 0.1)); // seconds between spawns
```

---

## 🎯 Game Loop Summary

```
1. Wave Start → Countdown (3-2-1)
2. Spawn meteors at intervals
3. Player shoots to destroy meteors
4. Meteors move toward planet
5. On hit: Damage planet OR destroy meteor
6. Wave complete when all meteors destroyed
7. Show score summary
8. Every 6th wave: Boss fight
9. After boss: Upgrade screen
10. Continue to next level or game over
```

## 🔑 Key Components

### Must-Have Components

1. **PlayerComponent**
   - Position: Orbital around planet
   - Movement: Clockwise/Counter-clockwise rotation
   - Actions: Shoot laser, launch missile

2. **MeteorComponent**
   - Types: Small (fast), Medium, Large (slow)
   - Movement: Straight line toward planet
   - Health: Takes damage, destroys on 0 HP

3. **PlanetComponent**
   - Health: Decreases on meteor impact
   - Visual: Shows damage state
   - Game Over: When health reaches 0

4. **WeaponSystem**
   - Laser: Fast, low damage
   - Missile: Slow, high damage
   - Projectiles: Handle collision, damage

5. **WaveManager**
   - Spawns meteors based on wave config
   - Tracks completion
   - Advances to next wave

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Performance
- Use object pooling for bullets and particles
- Limit active particles to < 500
- Batch sprite rendering when possible
- Remove off-screen objects immediately

### Game Feel
- Add screen shake on impacts
- Particle effects on all destructions
- Audio feedback for every action
- Smooth transitions between states

### Balancing
- Start easy (wave 1: 5 small meteors)
- Gradual difficulty increase (10% per 2 levels)
- Boss should be challenging but fair
- Upgrades should feel impactful

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Collision detection not working
**Solution:** Ensure both components have hitboxes added:
```dart
add(CircleHitbox());
```

### Issue: Laggy performance
**Solution:** 
- Check particle count (reduce if > 500)
- Use `SpriteBatch` for similar sprites
- Profile with Flutter DevTools

### Issue: Meteors spawning too fast
**Solution:** Adjust spawn rate in wave config:
```dart
double spawnRate = 2.0; // seconds between spawns
```
