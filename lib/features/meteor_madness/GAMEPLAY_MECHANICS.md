# Meteor Madness - Detailed Gameplay Mechanics

## ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay Systems

### 1. Player Movement System

#### Orbital Movement
The player's ship follows a circular orbit around the planet/station:

```
Orbit Radius: 200 units (pixels) from center
Angular Velocity: 180Â°/second (base speed)
Movement Controls:
  - Clockwise: Right arrow / Swipe right / D key
  - Counter-clockwise: Left arrow / Swipe left / A key
  - Quick Rotation: Double tap for 2x speed boost (2 seconds)
```

#### Movement Physics
- **Acceleration**: 0.5 seconds to reach max speed
- **Deceleration**: 0.3 seconds to stop
- **Momentum**: Smooth easing for natural feel
- **Collision**: Ship cannot leave orbit path

#### Advanced Movement
- **Dash Ability** (Unlocked Level 8):
  - Instant 90Â° rotation
  - Cooldown: 3 seconds
  - Cost: 50 energy

### 2. Targeting and Aiming System

#### Auto-Aim (Default)
```
Target Priority Algorithm:
1. Closest meteor to planet
2. Highest damage threat
3. Meteors in firing arc (Â±30Â°)
4. Special meteors (exploding, ultra-fast)
```

#### Manual Aim Mode
- **Activation**: Toggle button or hold aim key
- **Control**: Mouse/touch drag to aim
- **Laser Sight**: Visual trajectory line
- **Snap Assist**: Slight magnetic pull toward targets (15% strength)

#### Targeting Indicators
```
Color Codes:
  ðŸ”´ Red: Critical threat (< 2 seconds to impact)
  ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Moderate threat (2-4 seconds)
  ðŸŸ¢ Green: Low threat (> 4 seconds)

#### Spawn System
```
Spawn Zones: 8 sectors (45Â° each) around screen edge
Spawn Distance: 400 units from planet
Spawn Rate Formula: 
  Base Rate = 1 meteor/2 seconds
  Wave Modifier = Wave# Ã— 0.1
  Final Rate = Base Rate Ã— (1 + Wave Modifier)
```

#### Movement Patterns

**Standard Meteors:**
```javascript
// Pseudo-code
Vector target = planet.center
Vector direction = normalize(target - meteor.position)
meteor.velocity = direction Ã— meteor.speed
```

**Special Patterns:**

1. **Zigzag Meteors** (Level 7+):
```
Sine Wave Pattern:
  Amplitude: 50 units
  Frequency: 2 Hz
  Base direction: Toward planet
```

Spiral Pattern:
  Initial orbital radius: 350 units
  Decay rate: -5 units/second
  Angular velocity: 90Â°/second
```

  Max speed: 400 units/sec
  Warning: Red trail effect
```

#### Collision Detection
```
Collision Layers:
1. Weapon â†’ Meteor (damage calculation)
2. Meteor â†’ Planet (health reduction)
3. Explosion â†’ Nearby Meteors (area damage)
4. Shield â†’ Meteor (absorption)

Hit Detection:
  Circle-to-circle collision (radius-based)
  AABB pre-check for optimization
```

### 5. Damage Calculation System

#### Base Damage Formula
```
Actual Damage = Base Damage Ã— Multipliers Ã— Resistances

Multipliers:
- Critical Hit (5% chance): 2.0x
- Weapon Level: 1.0x + (Level Ã— 0.1)
- Overcharge Power-Up: 2.0x
- Combo Bonus: 1.0x + (Combo Ã— 0.05), max 1.5x

Resistances:
- Armored Meteor vs Laser: 0.5x (50% reduction)
- Armored Meteor vs Missile: 1.0x (no reduction)
- Shield vs Any: 0.0x (complete absorption)
```

#### Meteor Health System
```
Health States:
1. Full Health: 100-75% â†’ Normal appearance
2. Damaged: 74-40% â†’ Cracks appear
3. Critical: 39-1% â†’ Heavy cracks, pieces breaking off
4. Destroyed: 0% â†’ Explosion animation

Visual Feedback:
- Flash white on hit
- Shake based on damage % (small shake for 10%, large for 50%+)

```

### 7. Combo and Scoring System

#### Combo Mechanics
```
Combo Timer: 1.5 seconds
Combo Increment: +1 per meteor destroyed
Combo Reset: Timer expires OR meteor hits planet

Multiplier Calculation:

Combo Tiers:
  10 Combo: "Good!" + sparkle effect
  20 Combo: "Great!" + trail effect
  30 Combo: "Awesome!" + screen glow
  40 Combo: "Legendary!" + full screen effect
```

#### Score Calculation
```javascript
// Per Meteor
basePoints = meteor.pointValue
damageBonus = (damage dealt) Ã— 0.1
speedBonus = max(0, (expectedTime - actualTime) Ã— 10)
accuracyBonus = (hits / shots) Ã— 50

meteorScore = (basePoints + damageBonus + speedBonus + accuracyBonus) Ã— comboMultiplier

// Wave Completion
waveBonus = 500 Ã— waveNumber
perfectBonus = planetHealth == maxHealth ? 1000 : 0
timeBonus = remainingTime Ã— 10

totalScore += allMeteorScores + waveBonus + perfectBonus + timeBonus
```

### 8. Health and Damage System

#### Planet Health Mechanics
```
