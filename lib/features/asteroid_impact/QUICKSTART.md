# ⚡ Quick Start Guide - Asteroid Impact Calculator

## 🚀 Test the Feature Right Now

### 1. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Navigate to the Calculator

Option A - Using routes (add to your navigation):
```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, Routes.asteroidImpact);
```

Option B - Direct navigation:
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const AsteroidImpactPage(),
  ),
);
```

Option C - Update main.dart to show it on launch:
```dart
import 'package:neo_guard/features/asteroid_impact/presentation/pages/asteroid_impact_page.dart';

// In MaterialApp:
home: const AsteroidImpactPage(),
```

### 3. Test These Scenarios

1. Diameter: `10` meters
2. Velocity: `10` km/s
3. Location: Land
4. Press "Calculate Impact"
5. Expected: Green badge, small numbers

#### 🏙️ City Killer (City Destruction)
1. Diameter: `100` meters
2. Velocity: `20` km/s
3. Location: Land
4. Press "Calculate Impact"
5. Expected: Blue-Purple badge, moderate damage

#### 🌊 Ocean Impact with Tsunami
1. Diameter: `500` meters
2. Velocity: `25` km/s
3. Location: **Ocean** ⚠️
4. Press "Calculate Impact"
5. Expected: Tsunami warning animation appears!

#### 💀 Dinosaur Killer (Extinction Level)
1. Diameter: `10000` meters (10 km!)
2. Velocity: `20` km/s
3. Location: Land
4. Press "Calculate Impact"
5. Expected: Red badge, massive numbers

## 🎬 What to Watch For

### Real-time Preview
- Type in the diameter field
- Wait 300ms
- Results auto-update below (no calculate button needed!)

### Full Animation Sequence
1. Press "Calculate Impact" button
2. **0.0s**: Red crosshair appears on target
3. **0.0-1.5s**: Asteroid falls from sky with rotation and particle trail
4. **1.5s**: IMPACT! Screen shakes
5. **1.5-3.0s**: Explosion with expanding shockwaves
6. **3.0s+**: Results displayed

### Tsunami Animation
- Only appears when "Ocean" is selected
- 8 wave layers animate bottom-to-top
- Pulsing effect
- Blue gradient theme

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Small Asteroid (10m, 10 km/s)
```
Impact Energy: ~0.02 MT
Crater Diameter: ~30 m
Damage Radius: ~0.7 km
Severity: LOCAL DAMAGE
```

### Medium Asteroid (100m, 20 km/s)
```
Impact Energy: ~5 MT
Crater Diameter: ~150 m
Damage Radius: ~11 km
Severity: CITY DESTRUCTION
```

### Large Asteroid (1000m, 30 km/s)
```
Impact Energy: ~1,200 MT
Crater Diameter: ~600 m
Damage Radius: ~173 km
Severity: REGIONAL CATASTROPHE
```

### Extinction Event (10000m, 20 km/s)
```
Impact Energy: ~100,000+ MT
Crater Diameter: ~3000 m
Damage Radius: ~1,580 km
Severity: EXTINCTION LEVEL
```

## 🐛 Quick Debugging

### Nothing Happens When I Type
- Check console for errors
- Ensure values are valid numbers
- Wait 300ms for debounce

### Calculate Button Disabled
- Verify diameter > 0
- Verify velocity > 0
- Both fields must have valid numbers

### No Animation Playing
- Make sure you pressed "Calculate Impact" (not just typed values)
- Check that animation isn't still running from previous calculation
- Try pressing "New Simulation" to reset

### Route Not Found
Run this command to verify the route is added:
```bash
grep -r "asteroidImpact" lib/core/router/
```

Should show:
```
routes.dart: static const String asteroidImpact = '/asteroid-impact';
app_routers.dart: case Routes.asteroidImpact:
```

## 📱 Device Testing

### Mobile (Portrait)
- Single column layout
- Visualization at top
- Input panel below
- Results at bottom

### Tablet/Desktop (Landscape)
- Two column layout
- Left: Input + Results
- Right: Visualization

### Test on Different Screen Sizes
```bash
# iOS
flutter run -d iphone

# Android
flutter run -d android

# Web
flutter run -d chrome

# macOS
flutter run -d macos

# Windows
flutter run -d windows
```

## 🎨 Visual Checklist

### Starfield
- [ ] 150 stars visible
- [ ] Stars twinkle
- [ ] Different sizes

### Radar
- [ ] Continuous sweep
- [ ] Cyan colored rings
- [ ] Emanates from impact point

### Asteroid
- [ ] Falls from top
- [ ] Rotates during fall
- [ ] Has particle trail
- [ ] Gray rocky appearance

### Explosion
- [ ] 4 expanding rings
- [ ] 20 particles flying out
- [ ] Glowing white core
- [ ] Color gradient (white→yellow→orange→red)
